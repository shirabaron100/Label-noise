### Label-noise
## final project

Collecting large training datasets, annotated with high-quality labels, is costly and time-consuming. 
Indeed, labels may be polluted by label noise, due to; insufficient information, expert mistakes and encoding errors.
The problem is that errors in training labels that are not properly handled may deteriorate the accuracy of subsequent predictions, among other effects. 
Many works have been devoted to label noise and this paper will provides a concise and comprehensive introduction to this research topic.
In particular, it reviews the types of label noise, their consequences and the difference between how algorithms deals with label noise.
